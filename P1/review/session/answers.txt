Model: Referendum
Author: Fabrice Kordon

Task 1:
We have chosen the model because it was one of the more comprehensible models available.

Task 2:
From ready, to start and then voting, the model uses a sequence to transport the token. After voting a  conflict is present where depending on the variable v in Voter, where Voters is 1..15, the token transmits to the transition no or yes, where another sequence transports the token to their corresponding "voted"-place. 

Task 3:
In our chosen model, the only place with non-empty tokens is ready. This is because each voter only has one vote and the model is present to guide that token to their chosen vote.

Task 4:
a)
i) Deadlock:
As stated in the document, the model has a deadlock, since the tokens accumulate in "vote_yes" or "vote_no" and don't have a way to be reused.

ii) Dead transitions:
For a dead transition, one would simply need to add a transition before ready, to which no token could transmit. This would constitute a dead transition.

b)
i) Live:
Since the net has transitions, but also has a previously explained deadlock, it is not live.
