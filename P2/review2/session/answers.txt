Task 1.
a)

The main difference between OCL and SOIL is that SOIL has an imperative way to specify behavior.

b)

With an language like SOIL, Imperative control structures ( like loops and conditional execution) can be used.

c)

-if statements (conditional expression)
-while (loop)
-for (loop)
-Write(s:String) (basic I/O operations)
-recursion

d)

It's a language meant for objects and their relations to each other and therefore is a tool fitted for the job and not meant for a broader application (no higher order functions...)
Yet for the analysis of obejct oriented programs it is definitly well suited.
